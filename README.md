This project uses Q-learning to determine the best path to take to reach a given target from a set starting position

As an example, here's the generated table for a 3x3 board, with starting position as (0, 0) and target as (2, 2). With 2 obstacles at (2, 0) and (1, 2). (Look at visual image below for reference)
